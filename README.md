To use this repo, run the server with node server.js and the site with npm start.                                       The site will be hosted on http://ec2-18-221-135-84.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3456/
Just pick a random name and enter the chat room, duplicate names are not allowed.                                       The bottom nav bar will show your username, roome name, and two drop downs for the rooms currently created and members  in the current room, and a button for creating new rooms. Room names do not allow duplicates. as well.                  In rooms other than welcome, which have owner Z and everyone is welcomed, you can ban or kick members out of the room
as the owner. That will result in sending the member back to the welcome room and the only difference is that the       banned user can not enter back.
The creative portion is react and redux and react bootstrap.
